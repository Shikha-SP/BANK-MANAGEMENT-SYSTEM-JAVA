<h1> Bank Management System (Java)</h1>

This is my first Java project. A simple Bank Management System built using Java and NetBeans IDE. It includes a basic GUI where users can:

- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Transfer between accounts  
- Check balance  

I built this project while learning core Java concepts and how to design GUI applications using NetBeans' drag-and-drop interface.

<h3>Tools Used:</h3>

- Java  
- NetBeans IDE  

This project helped me understand object-oriented programming, GUI components, and event handling in Java.
